### Education

Central South University (CSU), Changsha, China

- Bachelor of Science in Statistics, **GPA: 3.77/4.0**

### Research Experience

1.Optimizing Regional Emergency Resource Allocation, *Reseach Assistant*

- Calculated regional resource risk through fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method and Markov Random Field
- Determined emergency resource supply points through combining two kinds of prototype based clustering algorithms: K means algorithm and Learning Vector Quantization algorithm
- Optimized the resource allocation of each resource supply points using BP neural network
- Implemented all modeling and algorithms in MATLAB

2.Research on Mobile Phone Recycling Management Model and Strategy, *Reseach Assistant*

- Built a cost model to analyze the impact of the recycling system on the cost of the first stage recycling process
- Designed primary level recycling sites and maximized revenue through static strategy game
- Designed optimal transportation route based on the network map of city recycling sites using graph theory and genetic algorithm
- Completed MATLAB programming and participated in writing and revising the paper

3.Distribution Law of Acoustic Emission Source after Attenuation, *Reseach Assistant*

- Determined the distribution law of acoustic emission source whose amplitude obey exponential distribution after attenuation using conditional probability and multiple integral
- Deduced the formula between b value and observation distance using MLE and least square estimation
- Compared acoustic emission test data with stochastic simulation in MATLAB to check the equation and the fitting results are excellent
- Calculated the b value before and after amplitude attenuation with different methods and discussed the b value

### Work Experience

Ernst & Young, *Conasultant Intern*, Shenzhen, China

- Advised Hubei Changjiang Publishing Group Co., Ltd. and Tianwen Digital Media Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. on the enhancement in the terms of development strategy, information system, internal information transfer and investment management through collecting samples and interviews

### Selected Projects

1.Data Mining Project: Application of Naive Bayesian Models

- Realized the learning and prediction of Naive Bayesian Models that based on maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian estimation using R language, and applied to marriage problems

2.Multivariate Statistical Analysis & Regression Analysis

- Conducted factor analysis, cluster analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machine using R for the construction and classification of urbanization level indicator system

- Conducted partial least squares regression, LASSO regression in R to select over 700 independent variables

3.Econometrics & Time Series Analysis

- Established a simultaneous equations model based on multiple regressions and a damped exponential model based on panel data in Eviews to study related influencing factors and decay laws of the daily box office results

- Established an ARMA model (using AIC and ESACF to determine model order) in R to identify, estimate, diagnose and predict the time series of urban employment population from 1952 to 2016
