### Research Experience

1.Optimizing Regional Emergency Resource Allocation, *Reseach Assistant*

- Calculated regional resource risk through fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method and Markov Random Field
- Determined emergency resource supply points through combining two kinds of prototype based clustering algorithms: K means algorithm and Learning Vector Quantization algorithm
- Optimized the resource allocation of each resource supply points using BP neural network
- Implemented all modeling and algorithms in MATLAB

2.Research on Mobile Phone Recycling Management Model and Strategy, *Reseach Assistant*

- Built a cost model to analyze the impact of the recycling system on the cost of the first stage recycling process
- Designed primary level recycling sites and maximized revenue through static strategy game
- Designed optimal transportation route based on the network map of city recycling sites using graph theory and genetic algorithm
- Completed MATLAB programming and participated in writing and revising the paper

3.Distribution Law of Acoustic Emission Source after Attenuation, *Reseach Assistant*

- Determined the distribution law of acoustic emission source whose amplitude obey exponential distribution after attenuation using conditional probability and multiple integral
- Deduced the formula between b value and observation distance using MLE and least square estimation
- Compared acoustic emission test data with stochastic simulation in MATLAB to check the equation and the fitting results are excellent
- Calculated the b value before and after amplitude attenuation with different methods and discussed the b value

### Work Experience

Ernst & Young, *Conasultant Intern*, Shenzhen, China

- Advised Hubei Changjiang Publishing Group Co., Ltd. and Tianwen Digital Media Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. on the enhancement in the terms of development strategy, information system, internal information transfer and investment management through collecting samples and interviews
